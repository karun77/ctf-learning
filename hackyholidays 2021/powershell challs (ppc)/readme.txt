//Subtask 2:

You're playing scrabble with your friends. You have the letters "iydhlao". Which are the words you can form? First sort them by increasing size, then 
alphabetically. Only include words of two letters and more. Make use of the dictionary file "dictionary" in /workdir. Example excerpt given below 
for different letters:
..
pad
pea
aped
deaf
